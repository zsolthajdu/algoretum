# Algoretum

Repository to experiement with different - mainly C++ - implementations of some of the basic algorithms and data structures.
Mainly dealing with graphs, trees and sorting.

The library uses CMake as the build tool and gcc / Visual Studio as the compilers.
To build the executables you'll need the CMake package.
* To create a Makefile, run 'cmake .'
* To create a Makefile for unoptimized debug build, with symbol information, run: cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
* Build executables on Linux : by running 'make' .
* On Windows Visual Studio Express can be used. CMake will create a compatible project.
